'''
CURRENTLY, this program can only take pcap files with one device at a time


detect burst, matching with signature, if it matches - says it is this device + event
if just one of two is missing -> generalizing w mac identifier for brand

output:
brand, type of device, times of the events

matching algorithms for correlations, threshold for matching
