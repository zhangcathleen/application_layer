To use this application:
./signature <Name of Pcap File>

Make sure that pyshark is installed and the pcap files are encrypted.

In the signature program, there are lots of commented out code - which was the rememant of the correlation code (not the levenshire algorithm, but rather correlation with a 10% margin of error)
